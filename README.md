  <p>My journey to learn C# fundamentals in school</p>
</div>

## Introduction
Hi! My name is **Arya**, and I'm a 10th-grade student at a vocational high school in Indonesia. I'm majoring in **Software Development and Game Development (PPLG)**. Because the focus is on game development, we're taught the C# programming language.

This repository contains all the practice code, examples, assignments, and exercises given by the teachers at school.  
Feel free to explore my code and perhaps you'll enjoy learning too.

> [!NOTE]
> Comments and texts in the codes may be in Indonesian.
